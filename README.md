# RINX

It's super cold outside. You wanna go to a local outdoor rink to play some hockey and skate with your buds , but youre not 100% sure if its worth leaving the house in the cold only to arrive at a rink and see that its in terrible condition and needs a lot of work.

What is the solution?

To solve this, I decided to create an application that will be able to show the user which rinks are available to use, which ones need work, and which ones are out of commission. It will be able to show you locations of outdoor rinks in the city, provided by an admin user, give you a status of the rink, indicated by colored markers, providing notes to the user of what needs to be fixed on the rink, an image of the rink and the ability to add favorites. Additionally, there will be a view to view all the current, established indoor rinks in the city, with an ability to favorite those rinks as well, and a higher level authorization user admin page, which allows the higher level user to create new rinks to add to the map with all of the previously mentioned parameters.

In the future I am planning to:

Make it mobile friendly
